It can be applied to reconstruct landmarks like Notre-Dame Cathedral or Statue of Liberty from a large dataset of images that is available publicly. The Three Dimensional Representation give a more accurate perspective of the features of the landmarks by showing its different facets in a single representation.\r\n## Input Data\r\nThe project uses large number of publicly available images that can be obtained from either flickr or Google images. Dataset used comprises of unstructured images of a landmark from different views.\r\n## Algorithm Used\r\nThe main algorithm used in the project is\r\n* Feature Matching: SIFT and approximate nearest neighbour\r\n* Determining Camera Parameter: Structure From Motion\r\n\r\n## Team Members\r\n* Ameya Shringi as6520@g.rit.edu\r\n* Vishal Garg vg3660@g.rit.edu\r\n\r\n## References\r\nSnavely, Noah, Steven M.
